# KNN-NaiveBayesProject

This is a project on Classification for KNN and Naive Bayes. Here from the dataset features , we try to classify if the tumor is 'Normal' or 'Abnormal'

In the project , KNN algorithm as well Naive Bayes are used. Both algorithms predicts the value of the tumor with good accuracy.
